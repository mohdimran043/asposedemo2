This file describes what folder contains the assemblies you need to use with a particular version of the .NET Framework.



Folder						Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

net2.0						Contains assemblies that target .NET Framework 2.0.

net3.5_ClientProfile				Contains assemblies to use with .NET Framework 3.5 Client Profile.

net4.0						Contains assemblies to use with .NET Framework 4.0 and higher.

net4.0_ClientProfile				Contains assemblies to use with .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile.


All folders with names, such as net2.0_AuthenticodeSigned contain the assembly for the corresponding .NET Framework,
but the assembly is digitally signed with Authenticode. Note that a signed assembly may load slower than without Authenticode.
